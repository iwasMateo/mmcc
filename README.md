# My Minecraft Clone
## What is this
My Minecraft Clone (mmcc for short) is an attempt at replicating the internal functionality of the popular game Minecraft. 
This is an experiment by myself, since I want to attempt it without knowing much about how minecraft originally worked or knowing much about java.

## How do I use this?
Run this file with sudo:
$ sudo sh ./Starter.sh
This line should enable you to use the built in Terminal.
The current commands Include:
* Inventory [String subcommand] [int Slotx] [int Sloty] [String itemId] [int amount]
* subcommands for Inventory are:
  * get (do not include itemId and amount here)
  * set

## FAQ
### What parts exactly are you going to try to replicate?
I am trying to replicate purely behavior of entities as well as the player.
I will not be attempting to replicate the rendering or world-gen, since I don't think I can realistically do that by myself.
### Are you open to collaborations/contributions?
No. I am trying to do this by myself. It's a learning journey.
